This is a remake of an old game by one of my friends, polishing the overall quality of the game as well as changing a couple components (especially late-endgame).
Currently this is what I have planned (in order):
- Polish grammar & make things easier to understand
- Balance & Fix Funny Zone [FZ]
- Add the final 3 Tier Milestones (More automation!)
- Add a new endgame?

I hardly have any experience with coding, I've only ever used scratch.mit ðŸ˜­.
I will update very slowly, but please be patient and trust that I'm trying my best.
Credits to Citrine for the original game!
