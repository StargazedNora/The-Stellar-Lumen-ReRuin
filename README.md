# The Stellar Lumen: Refurbished Ruin

This is a remake of an old game by one of my friends, polishing the overall quality of the game as well as changing a couple components (especially late-endgame).
Currently this is what I have planned (in order):
- Polish grammar & make things easier to understand
- Balance & Fix Funny Zone [FZ]
- Add the final 3 Tier Milestones (More automation!)
- Add a new endgame?

I hardly have any experience with coding, I've only ever used scratch.mit ðŸ˜­.
I will update very slowly, but please be patient and trust that I'm trying my best.
Credits to Citrine for the original game!

# This uses The-Modding-Tree!!!

An incremental game engine based on The Prestige Tree. It still requires programming knowledge, but it's mostly pretty easy things and copy/pasting.

[Look here for a tutorial on getting started with modding with TMT](docs/tutorials/getting-started.md)

You can look in the [documentation](docs/!general-info.md) for more information on how it all works, or look at the code in layers.js to see what it all looks like.
